## Project development plan<br/>
<br/>
<p>The development of this project has been divided following the UX five layers model:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strategy: The company wants one website where to show the new events and the customers could make their bookings, at the same time that they create a strong corporative identity for the events.</li>
<li>Scope: The website need to answer 3 questions:</li>
<ul>
<li>•	Who are we?</li>
<li>•	What do we offer?</li>
<li>•	How can the visitor get what we offer?</li>
</ul>
<li>Structure: The website is divided in 3 pages:</li>
<ul>
<li>•	Index – Presentation of the new events.</li>
<li>•	Menu – Presentation of the food and drinks.</li>
<li>•	Next Events – How to book / when.</li>
</ul>
<li>Skeleton: The information’s organization is simple so the users can navigate easily through the content, get the information fast, and they should be able of complete the purchase at any moment:</li>
<ul>
<li>•	Header with navigation menu.</li>
<li>•	Main suggestive image.</li>
<li>•	Banner with booking access.</li>
<li>•	Content with big imagery.</li>
<li>•	Extra information (menu / location…).</li>
<li>•	Footer with social media links.</li>
</ul>
<li>Surface: Visual design of the website.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

## Design<br/>
<br/>

<p>The potential customers would be people between 25 and 45 years old, with a medium / high income. These group of people usually are professionals and they main device to connect socially is the mobile phone / tablet, for this reason the design of the website has been created focused on the mobile first approach.</p>

<p>The spaces are limited, and they must be reserved, this gives the event some exclusivity value. The idea around the name, exclusivity, and the type of food / drinks they will create define the colour scheme used for the website: The roaring 20’s.</p> 
<br/>
<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme_images/colour_palette.png"></h2>
<br/>
<p>The approach for the layout was focused on the power of the imagery. The visitor should feel the ambient and the “essence” of the events without need to read long texts. The images are telling the story. Based on this principle, we searched for powerful images that represent the concept clearly: nice food, exciting drinks, cool and relaxed people… all involved in a golden and dark ambient.</p>

<p>This was the proposed design for the different pages.</p>

<br/>
<div style="width:100%;">
<img src="assets/images/readme_images/home_mobile.png" width="32%">
<img src="assets/images/readme_images/menu_mobile.png" width="32%">
<img src="assets/images/readme_images/events_mobile.png" width="32%">
</div>
<br/>

<p>The typographies used are Asanine (used for the Hangfire logo), Montecarlo (used for the Speakeasy logo), and Barlow, a very easy to read typography that matches the retro and elegant style of the design (used for all the text on the website).</p>
<br/>

## Technologies used<br/>
<br/>

<p>The languages used are:</p>

<p>•	HTML 5</p>
<p>•	CSS</p>

<p>Also, during the creation of the different elements of the project, I used:</p>	

<p>•	Photoshop – Create and / or edit images like the logo.</p>
<p>•	Bootstrap 4.2.3 – To help with the responsive design.</p>
<p>•	JQuery – Used for the navigation bar on mobiles and the carousel on the index page.</p>
<p>•	Google Fonts – Used for the Barlow and Montecarlo font families.</p>
<p>•	Font Awesome – Used for the icons on all the pages.</p>
<p>•	Git – Used for the version control within Gitpod.</p>
<p>•	GitHub – Used to store the project.</p>
<p>•	GitPod – IDE used to develop the project. Used the Code Institute template to setup the IDE environment.</p>
<br/>

## Testing<br/>
<br/>
	
<p>The W3C validator has been used to ensure that every HTML and CSS files are free of syntax errors.</p>

<p>The website has been tested on different browsers:</p>

<p>•	Google Chrome</p>
<p>•	Microsoft Edge</p>
<p>•	Opera</p>
<p>•	Firefox</p>

<p>Also has been tested on different devices:</p>

<p>•	Laptop (Windows)</p>
<p>•	Desktop (Windows)</p>
<p>•	Android tablets</p>
<p>•	Mobile phones (Android)</p>
<br/>
<p>More testing has been done about usability and user experience. To achieve this, I proposed to some friends to navigate through the website and answer the questions about the UX goals explained before:</p>

<h3>First Time Visitors</h3>

<p>•	Should be able to answer the 3 questions we proposed before (Who are we? / What do we offer? / How can I get it?) easily.</p>
<ul>
<li>The users can identify the brand, the name of the events, what are the events about and how to book them.</li>
</ul>
<p>•	Should feel the ambience and the Speakeasy story.</p>
<ul>
<li>The users understand the kind of events that the company offers and their ambience / style.</li>
</ul>
<p>•	Should be comfortable searching for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>The user can easily find more information when required.</li>
</ul>
<p>•	Should want to share the website with others.</p>
<ul>
<li>The perceptions of the website are: “stylish”, “elegant” and “beautiful” and they would share it with friends</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3>Returning visitors</h3>

<p>•	Should want to see when new events / menus are available.</p>
<ul>
<li>When returning, the users go directly to see if there are new menus or events.</li>
</ul>
<p>•	Should be able to book fast.</p>
<ul>
<li>The users find very easy to book for upcoming events.</li>
</ul>
<p>•	Should be reassured on the feeling about the events..</p>
<ul>
<li>The users enjoyed with the quality of the images, and they can visualize themselves in the event.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3>Frequent visitors</h3>

<p>•	Should want to see when new events / menus are available.</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, the users check if there are new events and / or new menus.</li>
</ul>
<p>•	Should be able to book fast.</p>
<ul>
<li>The users can book from the first page, and they can book at any moment during their visit.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

## Bugs<br/>
<br/>
<p>During the development process, and later on during the testing, some bugs / deficiencies have been detected. Some were functionals (links not working,...), some were about interaction (buttons are clearly interactive, accessibility...), some aesthetics (colors, sizes,...)</p>
<p>One of them has been detected during the testing when some volunteers pointed out that when they open the website, the main image and the banner filled all the screen so they didn't know that there was more content if they scroll down the screen.</p>
<p>I decided to change the height of the main images, so some of the other content would be visible giving continuity to the page.</p>
<p>Almost all the discovered bugs have been solved except this one:</p>	
<p>On the header, on some devices appears a white line between the header and the navigation bar.</p>

## Note about commits on this project<br/>
<br/>
	
<p>After conversations with my mentor in this project, I decided to create a new repository and clone the commits because the commit messages were not clear enough to be useful for other possible developers. So, these are the same commits than in the original repository, but the messages are more descriptive about the commit.</p>
